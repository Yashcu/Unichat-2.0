## Brief Description
UniChat is a modern, AI-integrated full-stack web platform designed to centralize academic communication, task management, collaboration, and personal productivity for universities. It replaces fragmented tools like WhatsApp, email, LMS forums, and third-party calendars with a secure, role-based environment that respects student privacy while enabling smarter workflows for students, faculty, and admins. The platform provides a real-time communication hub, a smart AI assistant for summarizing and planning, and productivity tools tailored for university lifeâ€”all accessible from a single dashboard.
